# Tick_Tack_Toe
Simple Tick_Tack_Toe game made with PyAutoGUI framework.<br/>
This was my third program with python. You can play against a computer or against your friends on the same pc.<br/>
It has some minor bugs but it works well.<br/>

# Kartuvės
Again this is a simple PyAutoGUI game of a hangman.<br/>
This app takes a random word from a list(Lithuanian) and asks a player to guess it.<br/>
The only reason I made this app is that I wanted to learn how to dynamically change pictures in a window and how to manipulate text in a window.<br/>

# Kalėdinės kortelės WEB
I haven't finished this app but it is my first attempt at making a web application.<br/>
It is made using Django framework.<br/>
The idea was that during the normal Christmas my family and I would exchange presents(we would do a secret Santa) but now because of quarantine, we couldn't do it normally<br/> so I made this web application where it would automatically sort all people and assign them pairs. It also has an "Admin page with password: raktas123" where you can add, remove people.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the Python code is in -> "\Kalėdines kortelės WEB\KaleduKorteles\main\views.py"<br/>
Most of the HTML code is in -> "\Kalėdines kortelės WEB\KaleduKorteles\main\templates\main"<br/>
<br/>
If you don't know Djnago, to start a webserver so see this page you need to download this repository go to „C:_____\Kalėdines kortelės WEB\KaleduKorteles“<br/>
open up cmd.exe in this folder and type in „python manage.py runserver“ then in your web browser enter the IP that you will see in the cmd window(https://).<br/>
